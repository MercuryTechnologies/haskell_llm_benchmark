# Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to implement the following functions:

- `boardString`
- `canAttack`

You will find the type signatures already in place, but it is up to you
to define the functions.

Positions are specified as two-tuples:

- The first element is the row (rank in Chess terms).
- The second element is is the column (file in Chess terms).
- (0, 0) is the top left of the board, (0, 7) is the upper right,
- (7, 0) is the bottom left, and (7, 7) is the bottom right.
