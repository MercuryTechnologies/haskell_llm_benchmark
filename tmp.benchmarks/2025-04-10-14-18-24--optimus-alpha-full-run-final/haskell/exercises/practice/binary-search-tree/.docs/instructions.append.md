# Hints

To complete this exercise you need to create the data type `BST`,
with `Eq` and `Show` instances, and implement the functions:

- `bstLeft`
- `bstRight`
- `bstValue`
- `empty`
- `fromList`
- `insert`
- `singleton`
- `toList`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
