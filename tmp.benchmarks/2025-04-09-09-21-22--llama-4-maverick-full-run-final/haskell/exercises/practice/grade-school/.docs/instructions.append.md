# Hints

To complete this exercise you need to create the data type `School`
and implement the following functions:

- `add`
- `empty`
- `grade`
- `sorted`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in
place, but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful
data type, newtype or type synonym.
