# Hints

For the appropriate amount of challenge here, you should only
use functionality present in Prelude. Try not to use Data.List,
Data.Char, Data.Bits, or Numeric.

Try and use seq, $!, or BangPatterns appropriately to ensure
that the solution is efficient.

Handling invalid input is not necessary.

If you've done the Octal exercise, perhaps you should generalize it.
