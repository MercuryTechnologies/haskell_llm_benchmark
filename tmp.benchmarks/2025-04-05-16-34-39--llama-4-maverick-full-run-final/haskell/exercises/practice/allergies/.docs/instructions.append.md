# Hints

To complete this exercise you need to to create the data type `Allergen`,
with `Eq` and `Show` instances, and implement the following functions:

- `allergies`
- `isAllergicTo`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
