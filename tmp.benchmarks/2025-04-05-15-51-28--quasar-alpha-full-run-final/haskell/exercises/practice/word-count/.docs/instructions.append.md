# Hints

To complete this exercise you need to implement the function `wordCount`,
that takes a *text* and returns how many times each *word* appears.

If it is your first time solving this exercise, it is recommended that you
stick to the provided signature:

```haskell
wordCount :: String -> [(String, Int)]
```

Later, it may be a good idea to revisit this problem and play with other data
types and libraries:

- `Text`, from package *text*.
- `Map`, from package *containers*.
- `MultiSet`, from package *multiset*

The test suite was intentionally designed to accept almost any type signature
that makes sense, so you are encouraged to find the one you think is the best.
