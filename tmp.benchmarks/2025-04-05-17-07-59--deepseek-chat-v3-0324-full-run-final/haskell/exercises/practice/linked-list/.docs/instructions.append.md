# Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `Deque`
and implement the following functions:

- `mkDeque`
- `pop`
- `push`
- `unshift`
- `shift`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
